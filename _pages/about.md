#### About me
I am a first-year `Postdoctoral Research Fellow` at [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/) and [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) advised by [Dr. Evan Bordt](https://www.bordtlab.com/). 

Supported by the Robert and Donna Landreth Fellowship, I work on several projects aimed at understanding environmental and genetic contributions to autism spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

When I am not at the lab, I enjoy surrounding myself with nature and lending a voice to environmental and DEIA initiatives in the greater Boston community.
