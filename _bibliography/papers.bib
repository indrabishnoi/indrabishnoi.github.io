  abstract={Microglia are exceptionally dynamic resident innate immune cells within the central nervous system, existing on a continuum of morphologies and functions throughout their lifespan. They play vital roles in response to injuries and infections, clearing cellular debris, and maintaining neural homeostasis throughout development. Emerging research suggests that microglia are strongly influenced by biological factors, including sex, developmental stage, and their local environment. This review synthesizes findings on sex differences in microglial morphology and function in key brain regions, including the frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, across the lifespan. Where available, we examine how gonadal hormones influence these microglial characteristics. Additionally, we highlight the limitations of relying solely on morphology to infer function and underscore the need for comprehensive, multimodal approaches to guide future research. Ultimately, this review aims to advance the dialogue on these spatiotemporally heterogeneous cells and their implications for sex differences in brain function and vulnerability to neurological and psychiatric disorders.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
